## PWA Install Prompt

### Overview

TeamTime encourages mobile users to install the app as a Progressive Web App (PWA) for faster access and a native app-like experience. A custom install prompt banner appears on mobile devices, providing platform-specific installation guidance.

### User Experience

#### On Android/Chrome

1. When visiting on a mobile browser that supports PWA installation, a banner appears above the bottom navigation
2. The banner displays "Install TeamTime" with an app icon and "Add to your home screen for quick access" message
3. Clicking "Install App" triggers the browser's native install dialog
4. Users can accept or dismiss the native prompt
5. After accepting, the app is added to the home screen and the banner disappears

#### On iOS Safari

1. Since iOS doesn't support the `beforeinstallprompt` API, the banner shows manual instructions
2. The banner displays "Install TeamTime" with a visual share icon
3. Instructions read: "Tap [share icon] then 'Add to Home Screen'"
4. Users follow the manual process to add the app to their home screen

#### Dismissing the Prompt

- Users can tap the X button to dismiss the prompt
- Once dismissed, the prompt will not appear again on that device/browser
- Dismissal preference is stored in localStorage and persists until browser data is cleared

### Implementation Details

**Component**: `src/lib/components/InstallPrompt.svelte`

**Integration**: Imported and rendered in `src/routes/(app)/+layout.svelte`

**Key Technologies**:
- `beforeinstallprompt` event (Chromium browsers)
- `navigator.userAgent` for platform detection
- `window.matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)')` for standalone detection
- `localStorage` for dismissal persistence

**localStorage Key**: `pwa-install-dismissed`
- Set to `'true'` when user dismisses
- Checked on component mount to determine visibility

### Display Conditions

The prompt appears when ALL of these conditions are met:
- User is on a mobile device (detected via user agent)
- App is NOT running in standalone mode (not already installed)
- User has NOT previously dismissed the prompt (no localStorage flag)

The prompt will NOT appear when ANY of these are true:
- User is on desktop (screens 1024px+ or desktop user agent)
- App is running in standalone/installed mode
- User has previously dismissed the prompt
- (Android/Chrome) The `beforeinstallprompt` event hasn't fired

### Styling

- **Position**: Fixed, 5rem from bottom (`bottom-20`) to appear above bottom nav
- **Z-index**: 50 (above content, below modals)
- **Design**: White rounded card with shadow, primary color accent
- **Responsive**: Hidden on desktop via `lg:hidden` class

### Testing

1. **Android Chrome Test**:
   - Open site in Chrome on Android
   - Verify banner appears with "Install App" button
   - Click button, verify native prompt appears
   - Accept install, verify app appears on home screen

2. **iOS Safari Test**:
   - Open site in Safari on iPhone/iPad
   - Verify banner shows share icon instructions
   - Follow instructions to add to home screen
   - Verify app opens in standalone mode

3. **Dismissal Test**:
   - View the prompt on mobile
   - Click X to dismiss
   - Refresh page, verify prompt does not reappear
   - Check localStorage for `pwa-install-dismissed` key

4. **Standalone Mode Test**:
   - Install app to home screen
   - Open from home screen icon
   - Verify prompt never appears in standalone mode

5. **Desktop Test**:
   - Open site on desktop browser
   - Verify prompt never appears regardless of window size

### Code Example

```svelte
<!-- Usage in layout -->
<script>
  import InstallPrompt from '$lib/components/InstallPrompt.svelte';
</script>

<!-- Renders above bottom navigation on mobile -->
<InstallPrompt />
```

## Item Pricing & eBay Routing

### Overview

TeamTime includes a specialized workflow for documenting item pricing decisions and routing items to appropriate sales channels (Store or eBay). This feature supports estate sale operations where items need to be priced, documented with photos, and potentially listed online.

### User Experience

#### Creating a Pricing Decision

1. Navigate to **Pricing** from the main navigation
2. Click **Price New Item** button
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Item Description** (required) — Describe the item
   - **Price** (required) — Set the price (must be positive)
   - **Price Justification** (required, min 10 chars) — Explain why this price was chosen
   - **Destination** — Choose "Store" or "eBay"
   - **eBay Reason** (required for eBay) — Explain why item should be listed online
   - **Photos** (required) — Capture at least one photo of the item
4. GPS location is captured automatically if permission granted
5. Submit to create an immutable pricing record

#### Viewing Pricing History

- **All Users**: Can view their own pricing decisions at `/pricing`
- **Managers/Admins**: Can view all pricing decisions across all users
- Each decision shows destination badge, description, price, and date

#### eBay Workflow

When an item is marked for eBay:
1. System automatically creates an eBay listing task
2. Task includes item description, price, justification, and photos
3. Users with "Can List on eBay" permission see tasks at `/ebay/tasks`
4. Users can claim tasks and mark them completed when listed

### Permissions

| Role | View Own | View All | Create | eBay Tasks |
|------|----------|----------|--------|------------|
| Staff | Yes | No | Yes | If permission granted |
| Purchaser | Yes | No | Yes | If permission granted |
| Manager | Yes | Yes | Yes | Always |
| Admin | Yes | Yes | Yes | Always |

**Special Permission**: `canListOnEbay`
- Enabled per-user in Admin → Users → [User] → Special Permissions
- Allows user to access eBay Tasks queue
- Managers and Admins always have this access

### Admin Analytics

Managers and Admins can access pricing analytics at `/admin/pricing`:
- **Date Range Filter** — Filter by start/end date (default: last 30 days)
- **Total Stats** — Total items priced and total value
- **By Destination** — Breakdown of Store vs eBay items
- **By User** — Items priced per user with total value and averages
- **Recent Decisions** — Quick links to recent pricing decisions

### Database Schema

**Tables**:
- `pricing_decisions` — Main record with user, item, price, destination, location
- `pricing_decision_photos` — Photos attached to pricing decisions

**Key Constraints**:
- Price must be positive
- Price justification minimum 10 characters
- eBay reason required when destination is 'ebay'
- Decisions are immutable (no updatedAt field)

## Inventory Drops (AI-Powered Batch Identification)

### Overview

Inventory Drops streamline bulk item submission for AI-powered identification. Instead of pricing items one-by-one, users can upload multiple photos and let Claude AI identify individual sellable items, suggest prices, and prepare them for pricing decisions.

### User Experience

#### Creating an Inventory Drop

1. Navigate to **Inventory** → **Drops** from the main navigation
2. Click **New Drop**
3. Upload photos (up to 10) via:
   - Drag-and-drop onto the upload zone
   - Click to select files
   - Camera capture on mobile
4. Add a description of the batch (e.g., "Kitchen items from estate sale")
5. Optionally add pick notes for context
6. Submit the drop

#### AI Processing

After submission, trigger AI processing:

1. View the drop detail page
2. Click **Process with AI**
3. Claude analyzes the photos and identifies:
   - Individual sellable items
   - Suggested prices (where confident)
   - Confidence scores (0.0 - 1.0)
   - Which photos contain each item

#### Post-Processing Workflow

Once processing completes:

1. Review identified items with confidence indicators:
   - **High** (green): 0.8+ confidence
   - **Medium** (yellow): 0.5-0.8 confidence
   - **Low** (red): Below 0.5 confidence
2. Click **Create Pricing** on any item to:
   - Pre-fill description from AI identification
   - Pre-fill suggested price (if available)
   - Attach relevant photos automatically
3. Complete the pricing form with destination (Store/eBay)
4. Item flows into standard pricing/eBay workflow

### Drop Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Pending** | Awaiting AI processing |
| **Processing** | AI analysis in progress |
| **Completed** | Items identified, ready for pricing |
| **Failed** | Processing error (can be retried) |

### Permissions

| Role | Create Drops | View Own | View All | Process |
|------|--------------|----------|----------|---------|
| Staff | No | - | - | - |
| Purchaser | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| Manager | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Admin | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

## AI Operations Assistants

### Overview

TeamTime includes three AI agents ("Shackled Mentats") that provide intelligent operations support:

1. **Office Manager** — Proactive daily operations
2. **Revenue Optimizer** — Pattern analysis and optimization
3. **Ada (Architecture Advisor)** — Interactive system design

### Office Manager

**Purpose**: Monitor attendance, track tasks, support onboarding, coordinate communication.

**Triggers**: Runs on a 15-minute cron schedule during business hours (7 AM - 7 PM).

**Available Tools**:
- `send_message` — Send direct messages to users or all staff (with cooldowns)
- `create_task` — Create follow-up tasks (with cooldowns)
- `cancel_task` — Cancel tasks with accountability tracking and user notification
- `view_schedule` — View work schedule by date and location
- `get_available_staff` — Query staff availability and clock-in status
- `send_sms` — Send SMS messages to users or all staff
- `trade_shifts` — Facilitate shift trades between users
- `create_schedule` — Create new schedule entries
- `delete_schedule` — Delete scheduled shifts
- `delete_duplicate_schedules` — Batch delete duplicate shifts
- `create_recurring_task` — Create recurring task templates
- `create_cash_count_task` — Create cash count tasks
- `process_inventory_photos` — Process inventory batch photos
- Permission management tools (view, grant, change user types)

**Broadcast Messaging**:
- `send_message` and `send_sms` support `toAllStaff: true` parameter
- Sends to all active non-admin staff members
- Useful for team-wide announcements and urgent notifications

**Cooldowns** (prevent spam):
- Messages: 30 min per user, 5 min global, 10/hour max
- Tasks: 60 min per user, 10 min global, 5/hour max

**Task Cancellation Features**:
- Cancel tasks that are no longer relevant
- Track accountability (counts as missed or not)
- Automatic notification to assigned user
- Full audit logging

**Configuration** (Admin → AI → Office Manager):
- Enable/disable agent
- Set tone (helpful parent, professional, casual, formal)
- Add custom instructions
- Configure cron schedule
- Set dry-run mode for testing

**Technical Notes**:
- **Attendance Context**: Shows ALL currently clocked-in users regardless of when they clocked in. Users clocked in >16 hours are flagged as "likely forgot to clock out"
- **Tool Parameter Validation**: User ID parameters require valid UUIDs. AI receives helpful error messages directing it to use `get_available_staff` to look up IDs by name
- **Streaming**: Tools with no required parameters (like `get_my_permissions`) are handled correctly with empty JSON defaulting to `{}`
- **AI Continuation**: After user confirms an action, the AI automatically continues processing remaining tasks instead of stopping. This enables multi-step workflows like "delete all duplicate schedules" to proceed without manual intervention after each confirmation

### Revenue Optimizer

**Purpose**: Analyze patterns across scheduling, tasks, expenses, and sales. Write long-term observations for the Office Manager.

**Triggers**: Runs nightly at 9pm (after store closing) for comprehensive analysis.

**Available Tools**:
- `write_memory` — Store observations about users, locations, or global patterns
- `create_policy` — Create guidelines for the Office Manager to follow
- `send_recommendation` — Send strategic insights to administrators
- `analyze_sales_patterns` — Analyze sales data and staffing patterns for insights

**Sales Analysis Types** (`analyze_sales_patterns` tool):
- `daily_summary` — Sales, retained, labor cost, profit per day, sales/labor hour
- `hourly_velocity` — How fast sales accumulate throughout the day (detects peak hours)
- `labor_efficiency` — Which staff correlate with higher sales days
- `vendor_performance` — Individual vendor sales, retained, days active, avg daily
- `weekly_trends` — Week-over-week sales, profit, labor costs

**Analysis Areas**:
- Scheduling efficiency
- Task completion rates
- Attendance patterns
- Workflow optimization
- Training needs
- Cost optimization

## AI Control Panel

### Overview

The AI Control Panel provides administrators with full control over AI agent behavior without requiring code changes. Configure which tools are enabled, set keywords that trigger specific behaviors, and manage context injection rules—all through a web interface.

### Access

**URL**: Admin → AI → Tool Control (`/admin/ai`)

### Features

#### Per-Agent Configuration

Each AI agent (Office Manager, Revenue Optimizer, Architect) can be configured independently:

- **Tool Enable/Disable**: Toggle individual tools on/off
- **Tool Confirmation Override**: Change whether a tool requires user approval
- **Force Keywords**: Define keywords that force a specific tool to run
- **Context Trigger Keywords**: Define keywords that inject specific context

#### Tool Configuration

For each tool, administrators can:

1. **Enable/Disable**: Turn tools on or off without code changes
2. **View Tool Details**: See description and default configuration
3. **Add Force Keywords**: When a user message contains these keywords, the tool will be forced to execute
4. **View Keyword Count**: See how many keywords are configured

**Example Force Keywords**:
- "apply schedule", "create schedule" → forces `create_schedule` tool
- "send sms", "text message" → forces `send_sms` tool

#### Context Provider Configuration

Context providers inject relevant data into AI prompts. Configure:

1. **Enable/Disable**: Control which context is available
2. **Priority Override**: Change the order context is assembled
3. **Trigger Keywords**: Define keywords that cause context injection
4. **Custom Context**: Add custom text to always include

**Available Context Providers**:
| Provider | Description | Default Priority |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| User Permissions | Current user's access rights | 5 |
| AI Memory | Stored observations and learnings | 10 |
| Staff Roster | Active users with IDs | 15 |
| Attendance | Clock-in/out status (includes forgotten clock-outs) | 20 |
| Tasks | Pending and recent tasks | 25 |
| Locations | Store locations | 30 |

**Example Context Keywords**:
- "schedule", "shift", "staff" → triggers Staff Roster context injection
- "task", "assignment" → triggers Tasks context injection

### Technical Implementation

#### Database Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `ai_tool_config` | Per-tool enable/disable and settings |
| `ai_tool_keywords` | Force keywords per tool |
| `ai_context_config` | Per-provider enable/disable and priority |
| `ai_context_keywords` | Trigger keywords per provider |

#### Cache Behavior

- **30-second TTL**: Configuration changes take effect within 30 seconds
- **Hot Reload**: No server restart required
- **Fallback**: Code defaults used when no database config exists
- **Immediate Invalidation**: Admin changes clear cache instantly

#### API Integration

The configuration service is used by:
- `orchestrator.ts` — Checks force keywords before LLM calls
- `context/index.ts` — Filters and orders context providers
- Admin UI — CRUD operations via form actions

### Files

- **Service**: `src/lib/ai/services/config-service.ts`
- **Schema**: `src/lib/server/db/schema.ts` (ai_tool_*, ai_context_* tables)
- **Admin UI**: `src/routes/(app)/admin/ai/+page.svelte` (Tool Control tab)
- **Server Actions**: `src/routes/(app)/admin/ai/+page.server.ts`

### Usage Example

**Scenario**: You want "create schedule" requests to always use the `create_schedule` tool, even if the AI might otherwise just describe what it would do.

1. Go to Admin → AI → Tool Control
2. Select "Office Manager" agent
3. Find `create_schedule` tool and expand it
4. Add force keyword: "create schedule"
5. Add force keyword: "apply schedule"

Now when a user says "create a schedule for next week", the system will force the `create_schedule` tool to run.

## Timezone Handling

### Overview

TeamTime operates in **Pacific Time (America/Los_Angeles)** for all business operations. The server runs in UTC, but all date/time operations are converted to/from Pacific timezone automatically.

### Key Behaviors

#### Server-Side Operations

All server-side date/time operations use Pacific timezone:

- **Clock In/Out**: Times recorded in Pacific, stored as UTC
- **Task Due Dates**: "End of day" means 11:59 PM Pacific
- **Task Rules**: Time windows (e.g., "before 10 AM") evaluated in Pacific
- **Cron Jobs**: Day-of-week and hour checks use Pacific time
- **Reports**: Date range filtering uses Pacific day boundaries
- **AI Context**: All date references provided to AI in Pacific format

#### Client-Side Display

All times displayed to users are in Pacific timezone:

- Dashboard clock times
- Message timestamps
- Schedule views
- "Today" indicators

#### DST Handling

The timezone utility automatically handles Daylight Saving Time:
- **PST** (Pacific Standard Time): UTC-8 (November - March)
- **PDT** (Pacific Daylight Time): UTC-7 (March - November)

### Technical Implementation

**Centralized Utility**: `src/lib/server/utils/timezone.ts`

```typescript
// Key functions available:
parsePacificDatetime(datetimeLocal)   // Parse datetime-local as Pacific
getPacificDayBounds(date)             // Get start/end of day in Pacific
getPacificDateParts(date)             // Get year/month/day/hour/etc in Pacific
toPacificDateString(date)             // Format as "Dec 13, 2025"
toPacificTimeString(date)             // Format as "9:30 AM"
toPacificDateTimeString(date)         // Full datetime format
createPacificDateTime(dateStr, h, m)  // Create Date from Pacific components
```

### Why Pacific Time?

TeamTime was built for Yakima Finds, a business operating in Washington State (Pacific timezone). All scheduling, task rules, and business logic are designed around Pacific business hours.

### Important Notes

1. **Database Storage**: All timestamps stored in UTC (PostgreSQL default)
2. **API Responses**: Dates returned as ISO strings (UTC)
3. **Form Inputs**: `datetime-local` inputs interpreted as Pacific
4. **First Clock-In**: "First clock-in of the day" triggers at Pacific midnight, not UTC midnight

## Task Assignment Rules (Automated Triggers)

### Overview

Task Assignment Rules enable automatic task creation based on real-time events like clock-in/out, time worked, or scheduled times. This automates routine task assignments like opening/closing cash counts.

### Trigger Types

| Trigger | Description | When Fires |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| `clock_in` | When any user clocks in | Inline with clock-in API |
| `clock_out` | When any user clocks out | Inline with clock-out API |
| `first_clock_in` | First person at location today | Inline with clock-in API |
| `last_clock_out` | Last person leaving location | Inline with clock-out API |
| `time_into_shift` | After X hours worked | Cron (every 15 min) |
| `task_completed` | When a specific task template is completed | Inline with task completion API |
| `schedule` | Cron-based scheduled time | Cron (every 15 min) |
| `closing_shift` | At specific time for clocked-in users | Cron (every 15 min) |

### Assignment Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `clocked_in_user` | Assign to the user who triggered the event |
| `specific_user` | Assign to a fixed user |
| `role_rotation` | Rotate through eligible users by role |
| `location_staff` | Assign to someone clocked in at location |
| `least_tasks` | Assign to user with fewest active tasks |

### Conditions

Rules can have optional conditions:
- **Location**: Only trigger at specific location
- **Days of Week**: Only trigger on certain days (0=Sunday, 6=Saturday)
- **Time Window**: Only trigger within time range (Pacific timezone)
- **Roles**: Only apply to users with certain roles

### Configuration

**URL**: Admin → Tasks → Rules (`/admin/tasks/rules`)

**Create a Rule**:
1. Go to Admin → Tasks → Rules
2. Click "New Rule"
3. Select trigger type
4. Configure trigger-specific settings (e.g., time into shift hours)
5. Set conditions (location, days, time window)
6. Choose assignment type
7. Select task template OR cash count config
8. Save and enable

### Cron Setup

Rules with `schedule`, `time_into_shift`, or `closing_shift` triggers require an external cron job:

```bash
# Every 15 minutes during business hours (Pacific)
*/15 18-23 * * 1-6 curl -s "http://localhost:3000/api/tasks/cron?secret=YOUR_CRON_SECRET"
*/15 0-5 * * 0,2-6 curl -s "http://localhost:3000/api/tasks/cron?secret=YOUR_CRON_SECRET"
```

### Technical Implementation

**Files**:
- `src/lib/server/services/task-rules.ts` — Rule processing logic
- `src/routes/api/tasks/cron/+server.ts` — Cron endpoint
- `src/routes/api/clock/in/+server.ts` — Clock-in trigger integration
- `src/routes/api/clock/out/+server.ts` — Clock-out trigger integration
- `src/routes/(app)/admin/tasks/rules/` — Admin UI

**Time Window Logic**:
- All times evaluated in Pacific timezone
- `"00:00"` as end time is treated as `"23:59"` (end of day)
- Wrap-around ranges supported (e.g., `"22:00"` to `"02:00"`)

**Deduplication**:
- Scheduled tasks: Checks last 14 minutes to prevent duplicates
- Time-into-shift: One per user per rule per day
- Closing-shift: One per user per rule per day

## Gamification System

### Overview

TeamTime includes a comprehensive gamification system designed to motivate employee performance through game theory principles. The system awards points for positive behaviors (on-time attendance, task completion, quality pricing) and applies penalties for negative behaviors (lateness, missed tasks, poor quality).

### Design Principles

1. **Variable Rewards**: Points vary by action quality, not just completion
2. **Loss Aversion**: Streaks create fear of losing progress

## Group Chat & Threads

### Overview

TeamTime includes a comprehensive group chat system with Slack-style threaded replies. Groups can be auto-synced with user types (employee categories) or created as custom groups by administrators.

### Key Features

1. **Auto-Synced Groups**: Each user type automatically gets a group chat. Membership syncs when users' types change.
2. **Custom Groups**: Admins can create arbitrary groups with manual membership control.
3. **Threaded Replies**: Click any message to open a slide-out thread panel for focused discussions.
4. **Group Conversations**: Each group has one persistent conversation that never ends.

### User Experience

#### Viewing Groups

1. Navigate to **Messages** from the main navigation
2. Groups appear in a dedicated "Group Chats" section at the top
3. Each group shows:
   - Colored avatar with first letter of group name
   - Member count
   - Last message preview
   - Unread indicator

#### Using Threads

1. In any conversation, messages with replies show a thread indicator
2. Click "View thread" or the reply count to open the thread panel
3. Thread panel slides in from the right
4. Reply within the thread to keep discussions organized
5. Thread replies don't clutter the main conversation

#### Group Management (Admin)

1. Navigate to **Admin → User Management → Groups**
2. View all groups with member counts and type indicators
3. Click **Sync User Types** to create/update groups for all user types
4. Click **+ Create Group** for custom groups
5. Manage individual group settings:
   - Edit name (custom groups only), description, and color
   - Add/remove members
   - Activate/deactivate groups
   - View the group chat directly

### Group Types

| Type | Description | Membership |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Auto-Synced** | Linked to a user type | Automatic based on user's type |
| **Custom** | Created by admin | Manual add/remove |

### Auto-Sync Behavior

When a user's user type changes:
1. They are removed from their old type's group (if auto-assigned)
2. They are added to their new type's group (if one exists)
3. Manually-added members are not affected by sync

### Permissions

| Action | Who Can Do It |

| Send messages | Members only |
| Create custom group | Admin |
| Sync user type groups | Admin |
| Add/remove members | Admin |
